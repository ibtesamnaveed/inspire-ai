AI-Powered Blog Title & Idea Generator
1. Overview

A website where users can input a topic/keyword (e.g., "Fitness") and the app generates catchy blog titles or content ideas using an AI API (like OpenAI API or free alternatives).

This project helps you practice React + API integration + modern UI/UX, which is exactly what’s trending.

2. Core Features (Must Have)

AI Generation

When user clicks Generate, the app calls the AI API and fetches blog title/ideas.

Display Results

Copy to Clipboard

Each result has a "Copy" button for easy use.

3. Optional Features (Nice to Have)

Multiple Modes – Choose "Blog Title", "YouTube Video Title", "Tweet Idea".

Loading Animation while waiting for AI response.

Responsive Layout for mobile & desktop.

4. Technical Requirements

Frontend: React (hooks like useState, useEffect)

Styling: CSS or TailwindCSS (for modern UI)
